Revision history for Wetware-Test-CreateTestSuite

0.03    2009.05.11 1540h

		Found out that we would need a Wetware::Test::Class::Load to
		solve a problem that Module::Build will copy over the pm files
		even IF they are in .svn or CVS subdirectories of lib.
		
		So we created the class, added the fun little 
		preprocessor portion to the File::Find:find() just like the POD
		said it would do what we wanted.
		
		Fixed up the 01_test_class.t to use the new Wetware::Test::Class
		and it looks like we are good to go.
		
		Also, opted to remove 
		
    		create_makefile_pl => 'traditional',
		
0.01    Date/time
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
