Wetware-Test-CreateTestSuite

The goal: automate the process of creating a Test::Class based TestSuite.pm
for each module Foo. So that there will be at least a Foo::TestSuite.pm that
can be run by a 01_test_class.t t/ test file.

This distribution provides both the Wetware::Test::CreateTestSuite module,
but also the front end script create_testsuite.

The script will write the skeleton of a Test::Class based TestSuite for
each module that does not appear to have a Foo::TestSuite. It will also
create three t/ files:

	'pod-coverage.t'
	'00_compile_pm.t'  
	'01_test_classes.t'

These accept the problem that IF there is a Test::Class::Load based 
TestSuite.pm in the lib, that it can NOT be 'used' "late" in the process.

REQUIRES

	Wetware::Test
	
	Wetware::CLI
